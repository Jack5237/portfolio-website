Engineering in 2026 is no longer about just writing code; it's about orchestration. The tools we use have evolved from simple text editors to integrated reasoning environments.

## 1. The Core Stack

My daily driver remains centered around the **Rust ecosystem** for performance-critical services, paired with **Next.js 16** for seamless full-stack orchestration.

## 2. AI & Reasoning

We've moved past simple autocompletion. Tools like **Cursor** and integrated agentic frameworks allow for high-level architectural planning that translates directly into robust implementations.

## 3. Hardware Essentials

Performance isn't just software. A split ergonomic setup and high-refresh minimalist displays are key to maintaining long-term flow states.

Stay tuned as I dive deeper into each of these categories in upcoming posts.
