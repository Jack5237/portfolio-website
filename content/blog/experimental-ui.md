Spatial computing is redefining the boundary of the 'window'. Our interfaces are becoming fluid, aware of depth and lighting, and most importantly, aware of the user's focus.

In this experiment, I've been exploring how we can use GLSL shaders and physics-based interactions to create menus that feel 'physical'.
